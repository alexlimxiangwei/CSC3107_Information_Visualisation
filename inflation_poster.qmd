# Introduction

<<<<<<< HEAD
Inflation, the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, eroding purchasing power, is a key economic indicator. It impacts everything from the cost of groceries to the interest rates on loans[^harvard_business_2024]. While moderate inflation is a sign of a growing economy, excessive inflation can reduce the value of money, leading to financial strain for consumers. In this project, we have built on a comprehensive visualization to monitor inflation across various consumer metrics in the USA, originally published by NBC News [^inflation_usa_2024] (@fig-nbc-on-poster). The visualization below shows monthly changes in consumer prices compared to the same time the previous year. Despite the visualization's effectiveness in showing an overview of the price changes, we aim to improve certain aspects to better highlight the underlying trend of inflation change in a year-over-year basis of different consumer metrics.

Inflation, the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and
services rises, eroding purchasing power, is a key economic indicator.
It impacts everything from the cost of groceries to the interest rates
on loans. While moderate inflation is a sign of a growing economy,
excessive inflation can reduce the value of money, leading to
uncertainty and financial strain for consumers and businesses alike.

In this project, we have developed a comprehensive visualization to
monitor inflation across various consumer metrics. Our aim is to provide
a clear, up-to-date picture of how inflation is affecting different
sectors of the economy. The chart below shows monthly changes in
consumer prices compared to the same time the previous year, offering
valuable insights into the current inflation trends. This visualization
will be updated regularly to reflect the latest data and help track the
trajectory of inflation over time.

# Strengths

-   The plot title and subtitle is clear and informative, immediately
    providing context and helping readers to understand the focus of the
    visualization.
-   The heatmap design effectively conveys a high information content
    without cluttering the plot. This allows for quick and intuitive
    understanding of the data trends.
-   Pointing with the mouse at a tile opens an infotip, enabling readers
    to retrieve specific incidence data for a given state and year
    (@fig-infotip_color_change). The infotip only occludes a small
    portion of the plot, and the partial transparency of the infotip
    ensures visibility of the tiles underneath.
-   The colors chosen (red and blue) are color-blind friendly, ensuring
    that the visualization is accessible to a wider audience.
-   The inclusion of detailed source information at the bottom of the
    chart adds credibility and transparency to the data presented.
-   The overall design is user-friendly, with a clean layout, intuitive
    color coding, and easy-to-read labels, making the visualization
    accessible to a broad audience.
-   The color legend is clear and informative which helps readers to
    quickly understand the meaning of the the colors (red-increasing
    inflation, blue-decreasing inflation) and the range of percentage
    changes displayed.

# Suggested Improvements

1.  *Adding more layers of information to the chart.*

    Information like:

    -   Inflation was due to major events like COVID-19, recessions, or
        weather changes (e.g. hotter/colder seasons)
    -   Inflation in different geographical locations

2.  *Varying the size of the square boxes* to convey additional
    information (e.g. size of industry, as each category has varying
    impacts on the economy.

3.  *Incorporate mirrored histograms, stacked histograms, or separate
    histograms* to present the data more effectively.

4.  *Shade areas* to represent significant events such as recessions or
    the COVID-19 pandemic.

5.  *Add an interactive straight line* for readers to follow across the
    graph, enhancing readability and comprehension.

6.  *Add a category like "Others"* to capture data that does not fit
    into the predefined categories, ensuring completeness.

# Implementation

## Data

-   Weekly counts of measles cases by state were obtained from Project
    Tycho.[^1] The data have missing weeks, which were treated as zero
    in @fig-wsj-on-poster, potentially underestimating the annual total.
    Instead, we calculated the weekly mean case count on the basis of
    non-missing data only.
-   Decennial U.S. census data for each state.[^2]

[^2]: <https://www.stats.indiana.edu/population/PopTotals/historic_counts_states.asp>

## Software

We used the Quarto publication framework and the R programming language,
along with the following third-party packages:

-   *readxl* for data import
-   *tidyverse* for data transformation, including *ggplot2* for
    visualization based on the grammar of graphics
-   *knitr* for dynamic document generation
-   *zoo* for interpolating annual population data from the decennial
    U.S. census

# Improved Visualization

# Further Suggestions for Interactivity

Because our visualization was intended for a poster, we did not
implement any interactive features, including the infotip. However, if
the data are visualized in an HTML document, interactive features can be
achieved using the R packages such as *plotly*. In that case, we
recommend that the tile does not change its fill color. In contrast, the
original visualization changes the fill color of the activated tile to
light blue (see @fig-infotip_color_change), which can be misinterpreted
as a change in incidence. Instead, we suggest highlighting the activated
tile by thickening its border.

# Conclusion

We successfully implemented all suggested improvements for the
non-interactive visualization. By labeling every state and choosing a
colorblind-friendly palette, the revised plot is more accessible. The
logarithmic color scale makes the decrease in incidence after the
introduction of the vaccine less striking but enables readers to detect
patterns in the low-incidence range more easily.
