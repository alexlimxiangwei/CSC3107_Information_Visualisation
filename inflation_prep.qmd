# Introduction

This document contains the data engineering required to reconstruct and improve the plot by @Joella_Carman and @Nigel_Chiwaya, shown in @NBC_News, depicting inflation year over year for major categories of goods (May 2023 to Apr 2024).

The code below requires the following packages:

```{r}
#| label: library
#| include: false
#| authors: Loh Xian Ming Jeremiah, Wong Zhen Line, Veleon Lim Ming Zhe, Farah Binte Mohamed Tajudeen, Lim Xiang Wei Alex, Javier Ng Wei Cheng

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(readxl)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(stringr)
library(grid)
library(dplyr)

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-inflation
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: "Visualising inflation in the USA from May 2023 to Apr 2024
#|  by @Joella_Carman and @Nigel_Chiwaya."

# Data Cleaning

@Joella_Carman and @Nigel_Chiwaya based their visualization data on [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/supplemental-files/) and [Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/) data, available in XLXS format with each row representing a major category of goods.

Instead of only May 2023 to Apr 2024, we will instead use data from Jan 2019 to Jan 2024. Having 5 years of data will give us a clearer picture of the inflation rates for the major categories of goods.

The data is separated into various XLXS files, one for each month. We will combine these files into a single data set, while also dropping columns that are not relevant for our analysis.

Relevant columns for data processing include: - `Expenditure category`: Category of goods - `Unadjusted percent change`: Inflation rate change year on year for the category

For our data processing purposes, we will only retain rows where `Expenditure category` is one of the following:

-   `All items`: Overall inflation

-   `Airline fares`: Airfare

-   `New and used motor vehicles`: Cars

-   `Apparel`: Clothing

-   `Shelter`: Housing costs

-   `Meats, poultry, fish, and eggs`: Meat and eggs

-   `Gasoline`: Gas

These categories are in line with those in the original plot shown in @NBC_News.

```{r}
#| label: merge-files
#| echo: false
#| include: false

# Get a list of all Consumer Price Index(CPI) XLSX file paths
xlsx_files <- list.files(path = "data/raw/cpi", pattern = "*.xlsx", full.names = TRUE)

# Filter out temporary files
xlsx_files <- xlsx_files[!grepl("~\\$", xlsx_files)]

# Read and combine the XLSX files, selecting the desired columns and skipping rows
# We also add columns for year and month of data
inflation_data <- map_dfr(xlsx_files,function(file) { 
  read_excel(file, skip = 6) |>
    # Select the relevant columns and clean up the data
    select(expenditure_category = 2,
           percent_change = 4)|>
      mutate(year = str_extract(basename(file), "\\d{4}"),  # Extract year from file name
      month = str_extract(basename(file), "\\d{2}(?!\\d)"),  # Extract month from file name
      expenditure_category = str_replace(expenditure_category, "\\(.*", ""))|>  # Remove parentheses and text inside to simplify category names
      filter(!is.na(expenditure_category))  # Remove rows with NA in expenditure_category
})

# Keep only the categories we are interested in
keep_categories <- c("All items", "Airline fares", "New and used motor vehicles", "Apparel", "Shelter", "Meats, poultry, fish, and eggs", "Gasoline ")
filtered_data <- inflation_data %>%
  filter(expenditure_category %in% keep_categories) |>
  mutate(expenditure_category = str_replace_all(expenditure_category, "New and used motor vehicles", "Vehicles")) |>
  mutate(expenditure_category = str_replace_all(expenditure_category, "Meats, poultry, fish, and eggs", "Meat and Eggs"))


```

For the next step, we will merge the data with the data on [electricity price](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/), which is not included in the original data set.

We chose to use Residential Average Price of Electricity in cents per Kilowatt hour for the U.S as we do not want to focus on commercial or industrial prices.

```{r}
#| label: merge-electricity-data
#| include: false
# Get a list of all the energy data XLSX file paths
xlsx_files <- list.files(path = "data/raw/energy", pattern = "*.xlsx", full.names = TRUE)

# Read and combine the XLSX files, calculate percentage change of energy
energy_data <- map_dfr(xlsx_files, ~{
  read_excel(.x, skip = 64, n_max = 1) %>%
    select(current_price = 2, previous_price = 3) %>%
    transmute(
      expenditure_category = "Energy",
      percent_change = round((current_price - previous_price) / previous_price * 100, 1),
      # Add year and month of each data point
      year = str_extract(basename(.x), "\\d{4}"),
      month = str_extract(basename(.x), "\\d{2}(?!\\d)")
    )
})

# Merge filtered CPI data and energy data
merged_data <- bind_rows(filtered_data, energy_data)

```

We then unite the year and month columns into one date column for ease of visualization and rename percent_change into inflation_rate.

We also wrap long category labels to prevent long category names from overlapping or extending beyond the plotting area.

Finally, we save the csv so we no longer need to run the time-consuming data cleaning code.

```{r}
#| label: finalise-long-data
#| echo: false

# merge year and month into date, rename percent_change to inflation_rate
long_data <- merged_data %>%
  unite(date, year, month, sep = "/") %>%
  rename(inflation_rate = percent_change)


# Wrap long expenditure category labels
long_data$expenditure_category <- str_wrap(long_data$expenditure_category, width = 20)
#view(long_data)

#Save the csv
write_csv(long_data, "data/merged/inflation_data.csv")

```

# COVID-19 data for contextualization

To enhance our understanding of inflation trends, we are incorporating COVID-19 data as a contextual variable. This additional dataset, sourced from the [World Health Organization](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/data/), comprises daily reported COVID-19 cases from January 2020 to January 2024. By integrating this information, we aim to provide a more comprehensive perspective on the factors potentially influencing inflation patterns during this period. This data enrichment allows us to explore possible correlations between the pandemic's progression and observed economic fluctuations, thereby offering a more nuanced analysis of inflationary trends.

We filtered the data to only include the United States of America and calculated the total number of COVID-19 cases reported each month. We then normalized the total cases to fit the 0.00 to 1.00 range for visualization purposes. To align the COVID-19 data with the inflation data, we removed the last 5 months of data to only include up to Jan 2024. We save the csv for future use at the end.

```{r}
#| label: merge-covid-data
#| include: false

covid_data <- read_csv("data/raw/covid/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv")

# Prepare the COVID-19 data
covid_data <- covid_data |>
  filter(Country == "United States of America") |> # Filter data for the United States of America
  select(Date_reported, New_cases) |>
  mutate(Date_reported = as.Date(Date_reported, "%m/%y")) |> # Convert to Date format
  group_by(month = floor_date(Date_reported, "month")) |> # Group by month
  summarise(total_cases = sum(New_cases, na.rm = TRUE)) |> # Calculate the total cases for each month
  
  mutate(month = format(month, "%Y/%m")) |> # Format the month to match the inflation data
  mutate(month = as.factor(month)) |> # Convert to a factor for proper alignment with non-date format
  # Normalize the total cases
  mutate(total_cases = (total_cases - min(total_cases, na.rm = TRUE)) / (max(total_cases, na.rm = TRUE) - min(total_cases, na.rm =TRUE))) |>
  slice(1:(n() - 5)) # Remove the 5 months data to only include up to Jan 2024

#Save the csv
write_csv(covid_data, "data/merged/covid_data.csv")
```
