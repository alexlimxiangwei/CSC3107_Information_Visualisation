# Introduction

This document contains the data engineering required to reconstruct and improve the plot by @Joella_Carman and @Nigel_Chiwaya, shown in @NBC_News, depicting inflation year over year for major categories of goods (May 2023 to Apr 2024).

The code below requires the following packages:

```{r}
#| label: library
#| message: false
#| authors: Loh Xian Ming Jeremiah, Wong Zhen Line, Veleon Lim Ming Zhe, Farah Binte Mohamed Tajudeen, Lim Xiang Wei Alex, Javier Ng Wei Cheng

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(readxl)
library(purrr)
library(pheatmap)

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-inflation
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: "Visualising inflation in the USA from May 2023 to Apr 2024
#|  by @Joella_Carman and @Nigel_Chiwaya."

```

# Data Cleaning

@Joella_Carman and @Nigel_Chiwaya based their visualization data on [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/supplemental-files/) and [Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/) data, available in XLXS format with each row representing a major category of goods.

Instead of only May 2023 to Apr 2024, we will instead use data from Jan 2019 to Mar 2024.(No data for April 2024 for electricity yet)
Having 5 years of data will give us a clearer picture of the inflation rates for the major categories of goods.

The data is separated into various XLXS files, one for each month. We will combine these files into a single data set, while also dropping columns that are not relevant for our analysis.

Relevant columns for data processing include: - `Expenditure category`: Category of goods - `Unadjusted percent change`: Inflation rate change year on year for the category

For our data processing purposes, we will only retain rows where `Expenditure category` is one of the following: - `All items`: Overall inflation - `Airline fares`: Airfare - `New and used motor vehicles`: Cars - `Apparel`: Clothing - `Shelter`: Housing costs - `Meats, poultry, fish, and eggs`: Meat and eggs - `Gasoline`: Gas


```{r}
#| label: merge-files
#| echo: false


# Get a list of all the XLSX file paths
xlsx_files <- list.files(path = "data/raw/cpi", pattern = "*.xlsx", full.names = TRUE)
#print("1st")
#head(xlsx_files)

# Filter out temporary files
xlsx_files <- xlsx_files[!grepl("~\\$", xlsx_files)]

#print("2nd")
#head(xlsx_files)

# Read and combine the XLSX files, selecting the desired columns and skipping rows
# We also add columns for year and month of data
inflation_data <- map_dfr(xlsx_files,function(file) { 
  read_excel(file, skip = 6) |>
    # Select the relevant columns and clean up the data
    select(expenditure_category = 2,
           percent_change = 4)|>
      mutate(year = str_extract(basename(file), "\\d{4}"),  # Extract year from file name
      month = str_extract(basename(file), "\\d{2}(?!\\d)"),  # Extract month from file name
      expenditure_category = str_replace(expenditure_category, "\\(.*", ""))|>  # Remove parentheses and text inside
      filter(!is.na(expenditure_category))  # Remove rows with NA in expenditure_category
})

#print("inflation data:")
#head(inflation_data)


# Keep only the categories we are interested in
keep_categories <- c("All items", "Airline fares", "New and used motor vehicles", "Apparel", "Shelter", "Meats, poultry, fish, and eggs", "Gasoline ")
filtered_data <- inflation_data %>%
  filter(expenditure_category %in% keep_categories)
print("filtered data:")
View(filtered_data)
```

For the next step, we will merge the data with the data on electricity price, which is not included in the original data set.

We chose to use Residential Average Price of Electricity in cents per Kilowatt hour for the U.S as we do not want to focus on commercial or industrial prices.


```{r}
#| label: merge-electricity
#| 
# Get a list of all the energy XLSX file paths
xlsx_files <- list.files(path = "data/raw/energy", pattern = "*.xlsx", full.names = TRUE)

energy_data <- map_dfr(xlsx_files,function(file) { 
  #only read row 66, rest are irrelevant
  read_excel(file, skip = 64, n_max = 1) |>
    # Select the relevant columns
    select(current_price = 2,
           previous_price = 3) |>
          mutate(percent_change = round((current_price - previous_price) / previous_price * 100, 1),
                year = str_extract(basename(file), "\\d{4}"),  # Extract year from file name
                month = str_extract(basename(file), "\\d{2}(?!\\d)"),
                expenditure_category = "Energy")  # Extract month from file name |>
})
# drop the current_price and previous_price columns
energy_data <- energy_data |>
  select(expenditure_category, percent_change, year, month)

# merge the data
merged_data <- bind_rows(filtered_data, energy_data)

```
Finally, We then pivot the data to a wide format, with each row representing a category of goods and each column representing the year and month of the inflation rate change year on year.
We then save the data to a CSV file for visualization and to avoid running the data processing code again as it is time consuming.
```{r}
#| label: pivot-data
#| echo: false

# Pivot the data to wide format
wide_data <- merged_data %>%
  unite(year_month, year, month, sep = "/") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year_month, 
              values_from = c(percent_change), 
              names_sep = "/")
write_csv(wide_data, "data/merged/filtered_wide_inflation_data.csv")
```


```{r}

# Read in the wide data
wide_data <- read_csv("data/merged/filtered_wide_inflation_data.csv")

# Convert the data to a matrix format for pheatmap
inflation_matrix <- as.matrix(wide_data[, -1])  # Remove the first column (expenditure_category)
rownames(inflation_matrix) <- wide_data$expenditure_category

# Plot the heatmap
pheatmap(inflation_matrix,
         cluster_rows = TRUE,
         cluster_cols = TRUE,
         show_rownames = TRUE,
         show_colnames = TRUE,
         main = "Inflation Rates for Selected Categories",
         fontsize_row = 10,
         fontsize_col = 8)
```
